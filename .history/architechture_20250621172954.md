# System Architecture

## Overview

The GraphRAG Medical Analysis System is built on a modular architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility in medical document processing and knowledge extraction.

## Core Components

### 1. Document Processing Layer (`processing_pipeline.py`)

**Purpose**: Handle ingestion and preprocessing of medical documents

**Components**:
- Document loaders (DOCX, PDF support planned)
- Semantic chunking using embedding-based segmentation
- Metadata extraction and preservation
- Document validation and quality checks

**Key Functions**:
```python
load_and_chunk_documents() -> List[Document]
```

### 2. Graph Construction Layer (`graph.py`)

**Purpose**: Build and manage the medical knowledge graph

**Components**:
- LLM-based entity extraction
- Relationship identification and mapping
- Graph document generation
- Neo4j integration and storage

**Key Functions**:
```python
store_graph_documents(graph_documents)
create_rag_chain(vector_store)
```

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation Engine

**Purpose**: Provide intelligent querying capabilities

**Components**:
- Hybrid retrieval strategy (vector + graph)
- Context aggregation from multiple sources
- Response generation with medical domain awareness
- Query optimization for clinical terminology

## Component Details

### LLM Integration

**Primary Model**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview
- **Reasoning**: Balance of performance and cost for medical text processing
- **Capabilities**: Complex medical reasoning, entity extraction, relationship identification

**Embedding Model**: Google Generative AI Embeddings (gemini-embedding-exp-03-07)
- **Purpose**: Semantic similarity for document retrieval
- **Optimization**: Fine-tuned for medical terminology

### Graph Database Schema

**Neo4j Implementation**:
```cypher
// Core entities
(:Patient)-[:HAS_CONDITION]->(:MedicalCondition)
(:Patient)-[:TAKES_MEDICATION]->(:Medication)
(:MedicalCondition)-[:TREATED_WITH]->(:Treatment)
(:Medication)-[:INTERACTS_WITH]->(:Medication)
(:Condition)-[:COMORBID_WITH]->(:Condition)

// Multimorbidity patterns
(:Patient)-[:HAS_MULTIMORBIDITY]->(:MultimorbidityPattern)
(:MultimorbidityPattern)-[:INCLUDES]->(:MedicalCondition)
```

### Retrieval Strategy

**Eager Strategy Implementation**:
- Vector similarity search for semantic matching
- Graph traversal for relationship discovery
- Context fusion from multiple retrieval paths
- Ranking based on clinical relevance

## Multimorbidity-Specific Architecture

### Specialized Components

1. **Comorbidity Pattern Detector**
   - Identifies common condition clusters
   - Maps interaction networks between diseases
   - Tracks temporal progression patterns

2. **Treatment Interaction Analyzer**
   - Models drug-drug interactions in multimorbid patients
   - Identifies contraindications across conditions
   - Optimizes treatment sequencing

3. **Cost Analysis Integration**
   - Healthcare utilization modeling
   - Economic impact assessment
   - Resource allocation optimization

### Data Models

**Multimorbidity Entity Types**:
- `Patient` (demographics, history)
- `Condition` (diagnosis, severity, duration)
- `Treatment` (medications, procedures, lifestyle)
- `Outcome` (clinical endpoints, quality measures)
- `Cost` (direct, indirect, opportunity costs)

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Document Processing**: Parallel processing of document batches
- **Graph Construction**: Distributed entity extraction
- **Query Processing**: Load balancing across multiple instances

### Performance Optimization

- **Caching**: Embedding cache for repeated document processing
- **Indexing**: Optimized Neo4j indexes for medical entities
- **Batching**: Bulk operations for graph updates

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

- **Local Processing**: All sensitive data remains within controlled environment
- **Encryption**: At-rest encryption for graph database
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to medical knowledge

### Compliance Framework

- **HIPAA Considerations**: De-identification of patient data
- **Research Ethics**: Appropriate use of medical literature
- **Data Governance**: Clear data lineage and audit trails

## Monitoring & Observability
