The project follows a modular design separating graph operations from processing pipeline logic. The test structure suggests the system will handle both connection management and RAG-based operations.

Use Case 1: ðŸ“„ Cardiac Case Study Features:
  - Complex medical case: Acute myocardial infarction with multiple comorbidities
  - Rich relationships: Patient â†” medications â†” conditions â†” procedures
  - Multiple entities: Drugs, diagnoses, lab values, procedures, outcomes
  - Clinical reasoning: Treatment decisions, complications, follow-up care
  - Educational content: Learning objectives and clinical pearls

  ðŸ§  Why This Works Well for GraphRAG:
  - Entity extraction: Medications, conditions, lab values, procedures
  - Relationship mapping: Drug interactions, comorbidity connections, cause-effect chains
  - Knowledge synthesis: Can answer questions about treatment protocols, risk factors, outcomes
  - Complex queries: "What medications interact with diabetes?" or "How does heart failure affect treatment?"

  The document is now ready in your documents/ folder. You can test your GraphRAG system with queries like:
  - "What are the patient's risk factors?"
  - "How are diabetes and heart disease connected?"
  - "What complications occurred during treatment?"
