## üí° GraphRAG Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. Sophisticated Query Capabilities

**Multimorbidity Pattern Analysis**:
```
"What are the most common three-condition clusters affecting cardiovascular, endocrine, and respiratory systems?"
```

**Clinical Decision Support**:
```
"For a patient with Type 2 diabetes and heart failure, what monitoring requirements and potential complications should be considered?"
```

**Population Health Insights**:
```
"How do multimorbidity patterns differ between basic (2+ conditions) and complex (3+ conditions, 3+ systems) presentations?"
```

### 2. Evidence-Based Relationship Mapping

The CPRD data enables creation of relationship weights based on real-world clinical evidence:
- **Co-occurrence frequencies** from population data
- **Temporal progressions** (condition A ‚Üí condition B)
- **System interactions** (cross-system condition clusters)

### 3. Clinical Terminology Standardization

**SNOMED CT Integration**:
- Standardized medical terminology
- International interoperability
- Hierarchical concept relationships
- Multi-language support potential

## üî¨ Advanced Analytics Possibilities

### 1. Multimorbidity Complexity Scoring
```python
def calculate_complexity_score(conditions):
    systems_affected = count_unique_systems(conditions)
    condition_count = len(conditions)
    interaction_complexity = calculate_interactions(conditions)
    
    return complexity_score
```

### 2. Care Pathway Optimization
- **Monitoring schedule coordination** across multiple conditions
- **Drug interaction analysis** for polypharmacy patients
- **Healthcare utilization prediction** based on condition clusters

### 3. Risk Stratification Models
- **Progression risk** from basic to complex multimorbidity
- **Hospitalization risk** based on condition combinations
- **Mortality risk** stratification for care planning

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Graph Construction
1. **Entity Creation**: Load 211 conditions with system classifications
2. **Code Mapping**: Import SNOMED CT codes and descriptions
3. **Relationship Building**: Create hierarchical and cross-reference relationships

### Phase 2: Advanced Relationships
1. **Multimorbidity Patterns**: Implement co-occurrence relationships
2. **Clinical Presentations**: Map condition variants and complications

- **Clinical context awareness** for complex multimorbid patients

### 2. Knowledge Discovery

- **System-level interactions** between different body systems
- **Care optimization opportunities** for complex patients

### 3. Research Applications
- **Health economics research** on multimorbidity cost impacts

## üîÑ Data Integration Workflow

### 1. Preprocessing
```python
def preprocess_cprd_data():
    disease_summary = load_disease_summary()
    codelists = load_all_codelists()
    test_values = load_test_values()
    
    return integrated_dataset
```

### 2. Graph Population
```python
def populate_graph_from_cprd():
    create_condition_nodes()
    create_body_system_nodes()
    create_medical_code_nodes()
    create_relationships()
    
    return populated_graph
```

### 3. Validation
```python
