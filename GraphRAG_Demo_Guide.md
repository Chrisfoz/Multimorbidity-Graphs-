# 🚀 GraphRAG Medical Knowledge Graph - Demo Guide

## 📋 Quick Setup

1. **Start Neo4j Desktop**
   - Open Neo4j Desktop
   - Start your database instance
   - Open Neo4j Browser (usually http://localhost:7474)

2. **Load the Knowledge Graph**
   - Copy and paste the contents of `neo4j_queries.cypher` into Neo4j Browser
   - Run the entire script (it will build the complete knowledge graph)

## 🎯 Key Demonstrations

### 1. Hub Disease Discovery
```cypher
MATCH (d:HubDisease)
RETURN d.name as disease, d.relationship_count as connections
ORDER BY d.relationship_count DESC;
```
**Shows:** Which diseases are most connected to others (GraphRAG identifies key conditions)

### 2. Strong Multimorbidity Patterns  
```cypher
MATCH (d1:Disease)-[r]->(d2:Disease)
WHERE r.strength > 0.7
RETURN d1.name as primary_condition, 
       d2.name as secondary_condition, 
       r.strength as correlation_strength
ORDER BY r.strength DESC;
```
**Shows:** High-probability disease combinations discovered by GraphRAG

### 3. Cross-System Interactions
```cypher
MATCH (d1:Disease)-[:AFFECTS_SYSTEM]->(s1:BodySystem)
MATCH (d2:Disease)-[:AFFECTS_SYSTEM]->(s2:BodySystem)
MATCH (d1)-[r]->(d2)
WHERE s1 <> s2
RETURN s1.name as system1, s2.name as system2, count(r) as interactions
ORDER BY interactions DESC;
```
**Shows:** How diseases bridge different body systems (GraphRAG reveals hidden connections)

### 4. Patient Risk Prediction
```cypher
MATCH (p:Patient)-[:HAS_CONDITION]->(d:Disease)
WITH p, collect(d.name) as conditions
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)-[:HAS_CONDITION]->(d1:Disease)-[r:LEADS_TO]->(d2:Disease)
RETURN p.id as patient, conditions, collect(d2.name) as predicted_risks;
```
**Shows:** What future conditions patients might develop (GraphRAG predictive power)

### 5. System Burden Analysis
```cypher
MATCH (s:BodySystem)
OPTIONAL MATCH (s)<-[:AFFECTS_SYSTEM]-(d:Disease)
RETURN s.name as body_system, count(d) as disease_count
ORDER BY disease_count DESC;
```
**Shows:** Which body systems carry the highest disease burden

## 🔍 Visual Exploration Commands

### See the Full Network
```cypher
MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 50;
```

### Focus on Diabetes Network
```cypher
MATCH path = (d:Disease {name: "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"})-[*1..2]-(connected)
RETURN path;
```

### Explore Cardiovascular Cluster
```cypher
MATCH (s:BodySystem {name: "Diseases of the Circulatory System"})<-[:AFFECTS_SYSTEM]-(d:Disease)
OPTIONAL MATCH (d)-[r]-(connected:Disease)
RETURN d, r, connected;
```

## 💡 GraphRAG Insights Revealed

The knowledge graph demonstrates how GraphRAG:

1. **Discovers Hidden Connections**: Links between diabetes and heart failure (65% correlation)
2. **Identifies Disease Hubs**: Type 2 Diabetes as central node with 6+ connections  
3. **Predicts Progression**: Diabetes → Diabetic Neuropathy (90% probability)
4. **Cross-System Analysis**: Endocrine-Cardiovascular interaction strength: 8.5/10
5. **Risk Stratification**: Obesity increases diabetes risk by 75%

## 🎨 Visualization Tips

- **Node size**: Larger nodes = more connections
- **Edge thickness**: Thicker edges = stronger relationships  
- **Colors**: Different colors for different body systems
- **Clustering**: Related diseases cluster together visually

## 📊 Business Impact Metrics

- **211 diseases** mapped from CPRD research
- **15 body systems** with interaction patterns
- **13 high-strength relationships** discovered
- **85%+ correlation** for key disease pairs
- **Real patient data** from 4+ million records

This demonstrates GraphRAG's power to transform static medical data into dynamic, queryable knowledge that reveals new insights for healthcare!
